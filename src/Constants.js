They wanted one that would be more inclusive, not one that isolated itself from outsiders. This new organization was never meant to be exclusive at all. Its members fully welcomed anyone, Filipino or not, who wanted to hang out with them and who could tolerate − or even contribute to − their quirkiness. To say ‘I can′t join OYFA; I′m not Filipino’ was not a good enough reason not to join; we′d reply, ‘So?’ Moreover, they wanted to be more involved in other parts of the University, not just their own members. Primarily, they wanted the members to have fun, while at the same time learning to get along, work, and have fun. Most important of all, the organization′s members would learn something about their own culture and would share it with others. Why? To truly understand Filipinos − and therefore ourselves − we really need to know where we have come from. So, OYFA was born..."

I'm Alessandra Paras, but everyone calls me Alex. I was raised in Roanoke, VA where my family became part of a tight-knit Filipino community, in which I learned to love my Filipino roots. Coming to college I wanted to keep that connection to the culture, and I thought that OYFA was a good way to do so! I'm premed student, but in my limited free time I like watching anything and everything on iWantTFC, so if you got recommendations, lmk!!!
