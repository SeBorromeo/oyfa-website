LOL just kidding. Hi there! My name is Brit and I am currently a second-year! I am super excited to be serving as one of your Scholarship chairs this year! Outside of OYFA, I am currently involved with UPC, UDems, and PAFN. Some things that I love are: coffee shops, squishmallows, Korean food, Japanese stationary, shopping, volleyball, Kpop, miniature things, surprise toys, fashion, and BREAD!!! <3 I absolutely love meeting and talking to new people so don't be a stranger! I am always down for anything hehe. Catch me in Nau Hall or the Starbucks in Newcomb :P. Favorite Quote: 'Lachimolala' - Park Jimin - Instagram: @britdaknee, BeReal: missbrit, TikTok: @britdaknee"}
