Maybe I'll cook, you never know.\n Anyways, I somehow found my way into OYFA my first year and was able to find people who I call my best friends and practically my family.

When I'm not doing anything related to school or OYFA, I love to bake, cook, eat sugar lol, run, read manga, and binge anime.\nBesides the above, I also love to see people smile. Seeing people happy with who they are and what they do is as addicting as sugar to me, and I always strive to create that environment it whatever situation I am in.\nAs for OYFA, it may sound clich√©, but OYFA has given me a home in the grand place that is UVA, and I am eternally grateful for that. Coming in as a first year during a pandemic was tough, but somehow, OYFA helped me grow in ways I never imagined, try new things I never would have given thought to (like dancing LOL), and let me meet and form friendships with people I will treasure or the rest of my life.\nSo enough of me already, we can talk about that another time. If you're reading this and you're on the website... see you at OYFA events and I hope to get to know you and see you smile :))"

              bio: "Hi hi friends - My name is Sam Dioneda, and I'm a second year nursing student serving as your Recording Secretary this school year. Outside of OYFA and being a nursing student, I am apart of MAN and was an OL this summer, so hi if you were an orientee of mine! When I'm not doing anything related to school or OYFA, I love to bake, cook, eat sugar lol, run, read manga, and binge anime.\nBesides the above, I also love to see people smile. Seeing people happy with who they are and what they do is as addicting as sugar to me, and I always strive to create that environment it whatever situation I am in.\nAs for OYFA, it may sound clich√©, but OYFA has given me a home in the grand place that is UVA, and I am eternally grateful for that. Coming in as a first year during a pandemic was tough, but somehow, OYFA helped me grow in ways I never imagined, try new things I never would have given thought to (like dancing LOL), and let me meet and form friendships with people I will treasure or the rest of my life.\nSo enough of me already, we can talk about that another time. If you're reading this and you're on the website... see you at OYFA events and I hope to get to know you and see you smile :))"

Seeing people happy with who they are and what they do is as addicting as sugar to me, and I always strive to create that environment it whatever situation I am in.\nAs for OYFA, it may sound clich√©, but OYFA has given me a home in the grand place that is UVA, and I am eternally grateful for that. Coming in as a first year during a pandemic was tough, but somehow, OYFA helped me grow in ways I never imagined, try new things I never would have given thought to (like dancing LOL), and let me meet and form friendships with people I will treasure or the rest of my life.\nSo enough of me already, we can talk about that another time. If you're reading this and you're on the website... see you at OYFA events and I hope to get to know you and see you smile :))"

Coming in as a first year during a pandemic was tough, but somehow, OYFA helped me grow in ways I never imagined, try new things I never would have given thought to (like dancing LOL), and let me meet and form friendships with people I will treasure or the rest of my life.\nSo enough of me already, we can talk about that another time.

LOVE. KUL2RA."

I'm a third year studying biomedical engineer and still don't have a single clue of what I'm doing after college. I enjoy: cooking, snowboarding, anime, volleyball, scary movies, music and the limited edition lime straw from TroSmo (NOT Trop).\nI was lil late to the OYFA party and didn't join till my second semester of my first year. Even with my \"late\" start everyone was so welcoming and genuine. I quickly found my place at UVA within OYFA. So join ASAP! and come out to our meetings and events, fill out the little form, go to that dance practice even if you don't know anyone, the whole nine. I can't wait to meet you all."

This outlet has helped me a lot with mental health and personal growth/wellness, both of which I‚Äôm also really passionate about. Every day I hope to share this with my communities and to open others to their creative, freely expressive sides."
