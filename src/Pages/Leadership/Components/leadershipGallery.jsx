/********************************************************************************************************************
** This is a comprehensive file which contains, from the highest level to the lowest level, LeadershipGallery,
** CommitteeGrid, CommitteeRow, Person, and PersonInfo classes. This allows you to simply follow the highest level call
** and simply pass a single array to automatically render the entire B&C page, or you can write custom code to 
** render a row, single committee, or just the textual committee info if you wish to rearrange things your own way.
** This is also done in anticipation of change, because say if in the future a new committee has been created, you can
** simply maintain the existing committees in the existing call and then tack on a "Person" class on a new row. 
** You may however need to change the width settings in the CSS file if you try to add a change.
*********************************************************************************************************************
** An Example class is also included in case you need to see how the calls are made.*/
